### How to run the code
The solution that I provide is in python3 and my version is 3.8, please make sure your python version is newer than 3.5 because I use `typing` which is 
the feature from version 3.5, any version below that might run in to syntax error.

1. make sure you have your python version >= 3.5
2. cd into the src folder
3. in your terminal, run `python testInventoryAllocator.py` and all the test case will be run


### File Structure 
There are only one folder here call src which contain all the codes
`InventoryAllocator.py` is the source code for this assessment
`testInventoryAllocator.py` is the test file for the `InventoryAllocator.py`


### Problem

The problem is compute the best way an order can be shipped (called shipments) given inventory across a set of warehouses (called inventory distribution). 
The task is to implement InventoryAllocator class to produce the cheapest shipment.
